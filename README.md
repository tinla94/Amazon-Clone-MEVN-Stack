**Demo**: https://overnightbooking.online

Amazong is an Amazon.com web application clone which is built for user to buy goods. 

# Fullstack Application

I built a Full-stack Application, using MEVN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node.js), a framework that have been popular around web-deveopment world.

## Back-End

1. **Nodejs**: a platform built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, and thus perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

2. **Express.js**: a Node.js framework. You can create the server and server-side code for an application like most of the other web languages but using JavaScript.

3. **PM2**: a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and to facilitate common system admin tasks.


## Front-End

4. **Bootstrap**: a CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

5. **Vue**: an open-source Model–view–viewmodel JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was created by Evan You.

6. **Nuxt**: a free and open source web application framework based on Vue.js, Node.js, Webpack and Babel.js. The framework is advertised as a "meta-framework for universal applications". 


## Database

7. **MongoDB**: a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema. 

## APIs

8. **AWS S3**: a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface.

9. **Stripe**: a technology company that builds economic infrastructure for the internet. Businesses of every size—from new startups to public companies—use our software to accept payments and manage their businesses online.

10. **Algolia**: a hosted search engine capable of delivering real-time results from the first keystroke. Algolia's powerful API lets you quickly and seamlessly implement search within your websites, mobile, and voice applications.


# Getting Started

To get you started you can clone the repository to your local machine: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tinla94/Amazon-Clone-MEVN-Stack

```

### Or

```
Download the repository
```

Also decide whether you will use `yarn` or `npm`.  My preference is `npm` and what the app was built on.  

**For npm**: Run `npm install` on **server**, **client**, **admin**.

**For yarn**: Run `yarn add` on on **server**, **client**, **admin**.

### Prerequisites

To run, first make sure you have Node installed. You can type `node -v` to find your version:

```
$ node -v 
v12.16.1
```

If you do not have Node installed. You can download from their website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ or you can install via Homebrew (need to install Homebrew first fo course). Here's a link to a guide: https://www.dyclassroom.com/howto-mac/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew

You will also need to have mongoDB for database management. I few options for you.

1. Start your local mongodb. Make sure you install mongoDB before starting below command

```
mongod
```

2. You can use **MongoAtlas** for virtual database.

Please look at `package.json` file for all dependencies that you will need to install.  For example you will need *parcel-bundler* which can be installed via npm.

# File Structure

1. **admin**: where products will be managed and added.

2. **client**: where user will shop, and buy products.

3. **server**: where business logics and apis are being managed.


# Deployment

1. **Digital Ocean**: provides developers cloud services that help to deploy and scale applications that run simultaneously on multiple computers.

2. **namecheap**:  an ICANN-accredited domain registrar and technology company.

3. **Cloudflare**: a web-infrastructure and website-security company, providing content-delivery-network services, DDoS mitigation, Internet security, and distributed domain-name-server services
